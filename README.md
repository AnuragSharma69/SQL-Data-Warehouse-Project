# 📊 SQL Data Warehouse Project

In this project, I built a multi-layered Data Warehouse architecture using the Bronze–Silver–Gold framework:

🔹 Bronze Layer (Raw Data):

Extracted data from multiple sources.

Inserted the data into the Bronze Layer without modifications, preserving the original raw format.

🔸 Silver Layer (Cleaned Data):

Performed data cleaning, standardization, and transformations.

Inserted the cleaned and structured data into the Silver Layer tables.

🏅 Gold Layer (Curated Data):

Combined and integrated data from the Silver Layer based on business rules and relationships.

Built final business-ready datasets for reporting, analytics, and dashboards.

# ✅ Key Steps

Extract → Load → Transform (ELT) process.

Ensured data quality, consistency, and reliability at each stage.

Designed optimized queries for faster reporting.

Final Gold Layer datasets are ready for BI tools and decision-making.
